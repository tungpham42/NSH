<strong>WHOIS</strong> (who is) is the aptly named Internet function that allows one to query
remote databases for domain registration information.
By performing a simple search, you can discover when and by whom a domain was registered,
contact information, and more. A search can also reveal the name or network mapped to a numerical IP address.
